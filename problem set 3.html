1.  You may complete this problem set in R or by hand.

2.  In either case, you must work through all the steps.

3.  You may use the worksheet to show your work or you may produce a document using R Studio that shows the code and results for each step in the worksheet.

4.  The format is up to you, as long as all steps are shown.

5.  Complete these items from the worksheet for all sequences of numbers: sum, n, n-1, mean, median, mode (if there is one), sum of squared differences from the mean, sample variance, sample standard deviation, population variance, population standard deviation.Â 

6.  Sequences:
